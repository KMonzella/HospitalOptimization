# HospitalOptimization
These programs locate underserved geographic areas in Chicago's hospital system (Julia) using geographic location of existing hospitals and census data on popultion density. Using this information, I identify the ideal location for a new hospital that would minimize the average population-weighted travel distance between hospital locations and Chicagoans.
